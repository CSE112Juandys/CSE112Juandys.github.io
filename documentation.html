		                                		<li>Code development went well in pairs/individually because each individual communicated and agreed on what they could do.</li>
		                                		<li>Weekly (almost daily) meetings led to a lot of communication in person. Our ability to meet was due to luck and our members' dedication. Some members had to sacrifice time from classes to meet.</li>
		                                		<li>Our "Hackathons" for each sprint (6 hour coding sessions) were successful and led to less stress overall. This is partially because the hackathons were not meant to finish work. Instead, they were meant to kick-off our work.</li>
		                                		<li>Team bonding went well because we set aside time that was not dedicated to work to bond and we did not work afterwards.</li>
		                                		<li>Overall communication through the Slack messaging service was useful because of the usage of channels.</li>

		                                		<li>Mistake: Creating tests after writing code led to struggles trying to create tests</li>
		                                		<li>Struggle: Using the pipeline properly and consistently did not occur</li>
		                                		<li>Mistake: Starting meetings with no agenda lead to aimless hours</li>
		                                		<li>Struggle: Thorough code documentation was forgotten about during the sprints</li>
		                                		<li>Mistake: Not having a schema and outline for how front-end, back-end, and tests all interact and come together led to tests not being written well</li>

                                        <h3>New User </h3>
                                        <p>I should be able to access the site at its URL, and it should greet me with a welcome page that gives me the option to sign up somewhere on it.  I should be able to click sign up, and then enter the required information to create a new account.  Once I have created my account, it should take me to the homescreen.  From this screen I should be able to see my own wall, as well as a list of my friends and a way to add friends.  Since I am a new user, I will have no friends added and my wall should be empty.  I will click the add friends button, and it will generate a link that I can send to my friends over text / messenger / whatever.  Once my friend follows that link and adds me as a friend, I should be able to see them in my friends list.  I should be able to click on their name and go to their wall.  I should be able to post to their wall, and also respond to anything they post to my wall with comments.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>

                                        <h3>Old User</h3>
                                        <p> My device should remember that I was logged in and I shouldn’t have to go through a login sequence, unless I specifically clicked log out.  I should be sent to my homepage, where I can see all the posts on my wall, both new and old.  I should be able to go to any of my friend’s walls and see all of the posts we’ve made to each other.  Some of the posts may be really old, so there should be an option for me to delete them.  When I delete them, there should be a sense of security and true deletion, and my friend and I shouldn’t be able to see that content any more.
                                        </p>
